# Projects from MA261: Differential Equations - Modelling and Numerics (Warwick University).
Numerical methods for ODE. Forward and Backward Euler, Crank Nicholson, Newton Raphson and some Runge-Kutta Methods.  All schemes rely on the functions `experiment` and `evolve` to porduce meaningful results.
