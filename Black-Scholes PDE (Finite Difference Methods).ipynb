    "\n",
    "A [*sparse matrix*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix) is a matrix in which most of the entries are zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "If most of the elements are nonzero, then the matrix is considered *dense*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dense matrix is typically stored as a two-dimensional array. Each entry in the array represents an element of the matrix and is accessed by the two indices i and j.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since a sparse matrix is almost empthy, storing all the zeros is a waste of memory. For this reason it is more efficient to use different data structures from the usual 2D arrays. More information on these can be found in the wiki page. \n",
    "\n",
    "Have a look at the manual page of the **scipy.sparse** library. [link](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to represent a sparse matrix, Scipy provides seven of them:\n",
    "- Block Sparse Row (BSR)\n",
    "- Coordinate list (COO)\n",
    "- Compressed Sparse Column (CSC)\n",
    "- Compressed Sparse Row (CSR)\n",
    "- DIAgonal storage (DIA)\n",
    "- Dictionary Of Keys (DOK)\n",
    "- List of lists (LIL)\n",

    "- All the others are better for the initial construction the sparse matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good thing is that it is very easy to convert one representation into one other. Here I pasted some recomandations from the scipy manual page:\n",
    "\n",
    "*To construct a matrix efficiently, use either dok_matrix or lil_matrix. The lil_matrix class supports basic slicing and fancy indexing with a similar syntax to NumPy arrays. The COO format may also be used to efficiently construct matrices. Despite their similarity to NumPy arrays, it is strongly discouraged to use NumPy functions directly on these matrices because NumPy may not properly convert them for computations, leading to unexpected (and incorrect) results. If you do want to apply a NumPy function to these matrices, first check if SciPy has its own implementation for the given sparse matrix class, or convert the sparse matrix to a NumPy array (e.g. using the toarray() method of the class) first before applying the method.\n",
    "To perform manipulations such as multiplication or inversion, first convert the matrix to either CSC or CSR format. The lil_matrix format is row-based, so conversion to CSR is efficient, whereas conversion to CSC is less so.\n",
